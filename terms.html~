            <li>You agree that your non-exclusive license to use the Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Software, and Gracenote Servers will terminate if you violate these restrictions. If your license terminates, you agree to cease any and all use of the Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Software, and Gracenote Servers. Gracenote reserves all rights in Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Software, and the Gracenote Servers, including all ownership rights. Under no circumstances will Gracenote become liable for any payment to you for any information that you provide. You agree that Gracenote may enforce its rights under this Agreement against you directly in its own name.</li>
            <li>The Gracenote service uses a unique identifier to track queries for statistical purposes.

    <li><p><em>Feedback.</em> We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Software (whether written, verbal or in any other format or manner) ("<em>Feedback</em>"). You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of Perk and you hereby irrevocably assign to Perk and agree to irrevocably assign to Perk all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including without limitation all worldwide patent rights, copyright rights, trade secret rights, and other proprietary or intellectual property rights therein. In jurisdictions where an assignment through this Agreement is not binding, you grant to Perks, in perpetuity, a world-wide, non-exclusive, sublicensable and transferable license to publish, display, reproduce, modify, edit or otherwise use all Feedback, in whole or in part, for any and all commercial purpose, purposes of trade, or for any other reason; and (ii) you hereby waive any and all moral rights in and to all Feedback.</p></li>
    <li><p>When you install the Software, including the Perk mobile applications, browser add-on, or any other Perk program or mobile application, you are adding a whole new set of functions to your Phone, Web browser and tablet such as alerts and notifications. Once you install any of the Perk add-ons, you agree for ease of use it will be visible in your Web browser window whenever you are connected to the Internet. The Application functionality is dependent on our Software which is designed to help ensure that you never miss an opportunity to earn points, coupons or special deals. When you enter the URL of an Affiliate Store's web site into your browser with the Perk Service installed, Perk is designed to recognize the Affiliate Store's website to determine whether there are points and/or coupons available. If there are points and/or coupons available, you will see an alert on the Browser or Perk Add On. You will then need to click on the alert which will initiate your tracking ticket unless you specifically come from a Perk shopping-related link. The Perk currency indicator will turn the color green when you are eligible to earn points. Our Browser Application and Software are automatically updated regularly based on communications with our Affiliate Stores identified on our Site.</p></li>

    <li><p><em>Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</em></p>
        <p>In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with the Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
        <ol>
        <li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or</li>
        <li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;</li>
        </ol>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us via the Perk.com Services. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers. <em>All points or tokens earned by a member who is later identified as being in violation of these terms will be removed from the account.</em>  Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to: <a href="mailto:support@perk.com">support@perk.com</a></p></li>
    <li><em>Confidentiality.</em> At times, we may make available to you pre-release versions of the Software. All the terms of this Agreement apply to such pre-release versions of the Software.

    <li><em>Term.</em> The license to the Software granted under these Terms of Service remains in effect for a period of 75 years, unless earlier terminated by you or Perk in accordance with this provision.
